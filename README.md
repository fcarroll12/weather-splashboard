## Description

- What was your motivation?

- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

My motivation for this project was to complete an interactive weather dashboard database where a user could enter and search any city's weather. Upon entering it would generate a 5 day forecast including a forecast for the current day above. It would show the temperature, the wind strength, humidity, and the UV Index for the current day. The website would use OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data, bootstrap as well as javascript to demonstrate full functionality. It also uses localStorage to store any persistent data. This functionable app solves any user problem's with planning a trip accordingly and packing appropriately.
